## Employee Data Exploration Using SQL
In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of employee-related data by working with a locally hosted SQL database. The data exploration and querying were carried out using **DBeaver** and **MySQL Workbench**, allowing for efficient insight generation from various relational tables.

## Core Activities
- **Integrated Data Sources**: Merged multiple tables — such as employee details, salary records, department assignments, and job titles — to build a comprehensive view of the workforce.

- **Workforce Analytics**: Evaluated salary patterns, monitored role and department changes, and highlighted employees with the highest earnings per department.

- **Historical Comparison**: Examined shifts in employee compensation by comparing present and past salary figures.

- **Employee Ranking**: Leveraged SQL window functions like ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), and NTILE() to rank individuals based on salary across different dimensions.

- **Managerial Data Insight**: Pulled current information regarding department managers, including their roles and pay.

## Technologies Employed
- **SQL**: Used extensively for data manipulation and analysis.
- **DBeaver & MySQL Workbench**: Served as the primary environments for running queries and managing database structures.

## Purpose of the Project
The project aimed to highlight practical SQL skills through real-world data analysis. It demonstrates the ability to pull valuable insights from employee data by using joins, aggregations, rankings, and temporal comparisons — providing a clearer picture of how personnel and pay structures evolve within an organization.
